"LESSONS FROM PREDICTING GROWTH AND RECESSIONS"
This repository contains R source code files for the book, "Lessons from Predicting Growth and Recessions" by Atin Basuchoudhary, James Bang, and Tinni Sen. We provide more information about how we have implemented the models and the rationale for the various model options in the code appendix to the book, which is available as a Springer Brief.
